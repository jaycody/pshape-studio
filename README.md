## Contours
From Rune's book:  
While we can draw most shapes with vertex(), quadraticVertex(), and bezierVertex(), these functions won't allow us to create shapes with holes. In P5.js, a hole is called a contour, and you can draw shapes with contours using the beginContour() and endContour() functions. In essence, the beginContour() function instructs P5 that you are starting a new shape that will be subtracted from your main shape. Like beginShape(), you use the vertex functions to draw your contour, and use endContour() to end the contour.
